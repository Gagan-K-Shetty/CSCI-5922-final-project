# CSCI-5922-final-project
This repo contains the code for the final project done as a part of course CSCI-5922

The code was run on Google Colabs, where we used google drive as the storage for the data.
For generating the images from stable diffusion, we use the captions from VizViz and generate the corresponding images using Dataset Gen.ipynb
Feature extraction was done using the Feature extraction.ipynb. The extracted features are stored in google drive.
The models were generated using the Model evaluation.ipynb. The model weights are stored in google drive.
